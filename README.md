# Master Microservices with Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes

This project demonstrates the implementation of microservices architecture using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Cloud**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes**, based on the course *"Master Microservices with Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes"*.

## Overview

This repository contains a practical example of building production-ready microservices. It includes configurations and implementations of microservices following best practices, cloud-native design patterns, and advanced tools for building, deploying, and managing microservices-based applications.

## Features Implemented

1. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - Explanation of microservices architecture and its differences from monolithic and SOA architectures.
   - Identification of service boundaries and right-sizing of microservices.

2. **Spring Boot & Spring Cloud**:
   - Development of production-ready microservices using Java, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud components.

3. **API Documentation**:
   - API documentation using **OpenAPI Specification** and **Swagger**.

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Centralized configuration management using **Spring Cloud Config Server**.

5. **Service Discovery & Registration**:
   - Implementation of service discovery and registration using **Spring Eureka Server**.

6. **Resilience**:
   - Built resilient microservices with **Resilience4J** to handle faults and improve reliability.

7. **API Gateway**:
   - Managed routing and cross-cutting concerns using **Spring Cloud Gateway**.

8. **Event-Driven Microservices**:
   - Asynchronous communication using **RabbitMQ**, **Apache Kafka**, **Spring Cloud Functions**, and **Spring Cloud Stream**.

9. **Observability**:
   - Observability and monitoring using **Prometheus**, **Loki**, **Promtail**, **Tempo**, and **Grafana**.

10. **Security**:
    - Secured microservices using **OAuth2**, **OpenID Connect**, and **Spring Security**.

11. **Docker Integration**:
    - Built and managed Docker images and containers.
    - Used **Docker Compose** to orchestrate microservices.

12. **Kubernetes Deployment**:
    - Deployed microservices using **Kubernetes** as the container orchestration framework.
    - Setup Kubernetes cluster in **Google Kubernetes Engine (GCP)**.

13. **Helm**:
    - Managed Kubernetes deployments with **Helm**.
