Wallet-wave Bank Microservices Platform
Purpose:
WalletWave is a production-grade bank application built with a microservices architecture using Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes. Designed for real-world financial services, this platform offers a secure, scalable, and resilient solution to handle core banking operations.

Overview:
This repository contains a practical implementation of a bank application built with modern microservices principles. It leverages best practices, cloud-native design patterns, and advanced tools for building, deploying, and managing a complex banking system.

Features Implemented:

Microservices Architecture:

Clearly defined service boundaries for core banking functions.
Robust separation of concerns to handle account management, transaction processing, customer service, and more.
Spring Boot & Spring Cloud:

Development of high-performance microservices using Java, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud components.
Seamless integration of cloud-native capabilities like centralized configuration and service discovery.
API Documentation:

Detailed API documentation powered by OpenAPI and Swagger for seamless integration and maintenance.
Configuration Management:

Centralized configuration using Spring Cloud Config Server for uniform settings management across all services.
Service Discovery & Registration:

Dynamic registration and discovery of services implemented with Spring Eureka Server to ensure efficient load balancing and high availability.
Resilience:

Fault tolerance and resiliency built into the system with Resilience4J to handle service interruptions and improve reliability.
API Gateway:

Secure and manageable routing using Spring Cloud Gateway to handle cross-cutting concerns such as security and monitoring.
Event-Driven Architecture:

Asynchronous communication for transactions and notifications using RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, and Spring Cloud Stream.
Observability:

Comprehensive monitoring and logging using Prometheus, Grafana, and related tools to maintain system health and performance.
Security:

Robust security measures using OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and Spring Security to protect sensitive financial data and transactions.
Docker & Kubernetes:

Containerization of microservices using Docker and orchestration via Kubernetes for easy deployment, scaling, and management.
Use of Helm for streamlined Kubernetes deployments.
Tools & Technologies:

Languages & Frameworks: Java 17+, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
Containerization & Orchestration: Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (GKE), Helm
Messaging & Event Streaming: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka
Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail, Tempo
Security: OAuth2, OpenID Connect, Spring Securit
