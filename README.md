>  **Microservices in Wallet-Wave**

- 🛡️ **Gateway**  
  Routes external traffic to services securely

- ⚙️ **Config Server**  
  Centralized configuration management

  

- **Eureka Server**  
  Service discovery and registration

-  **Service Discovery (Kubernetes Native)**  
  Kubernetes-based service discovery using built-in DNS and Services.  
  This approach replaces Eureka in cloud-native production deployments  
  and provides scalable, resilient inter-service communication.

-  **Accounts Service**  
  Account management (create, update, delete, fetch)

-  **Cards Service**  
  Manage debit/credit cards, card issuance and operations

-  **Loans Service**  
  Loan operations and management

-  **Message Service**  
  Asynchronous messaging (Kafka / RabbitMQ)


  ##  Observability & Monitoring

Wallet-Wave uses **Spring Boot Actuator**, **Prometheus**, and **Grafana** to provide real-time insight into
microservices health and performance.

### 🔹 Prometheus Targets
Prometheus collects metrics from each service (`/actuator/prometheus`).
